      question: "Can I reapply for home loan after rejection?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can reapply for home loan after rejection, but: (1) Fix rejection reason first - Address the reason for rejection (improve CIBIL, increase income, fix property issues, etc.), (2) Wait for improvement - Wait 3-6 months after fixing issues before reapplying, (3) Apply to different bank - Different banks have different criteria, try banks with flexible requirements, (4) Improve application - Prepare better application with all documents, add co-applicant if needed, (5) Get help - Work with loan manager to understand rejection and fix issues. Don't reapply immediately without fixing issues - This may lead to another rejection. Use our calculator to check eligibility after fixing issues.",

      question: "How long to wait before reapplying?",
      answer:

This allows: (1) Time to fix rejection reasons - Improve CIBIL, increase income, fix property issues, (2) CIBIL to improve - If rejected for low CIBIL, wait for score to improve, (3) Income to stabilize - If rejected for income, wait for salary increase or add co-applicant, (4) Property issues to resolve - If rejected for property, choose different property. However, waiting period depends on rejection reason: (1) Low CIBIL - Wait 3-6 months after improvements, (2) Insufficient income - Can reapply immediately with co-applicant, (3) Property issues - Can reapply immediately with different property. Don't reapply immediately without fixing issues.",

      question: "Should I reapply to same bank or different bank?",
      answer:

Reapply to different bank if: (1) Bank has very strict criteria, (2) Rejection was for property issues (try bank with flexible property criteria), (3) You want to compare offers. Generally, if you've fixed rejection reason, you can try same bank. If bank has strict criteria, try different bank with flexible requirements. Compare offers from 30+ banks to find best option.",

      question: "Will rejection affect future applications?",
      answer:
        "Rejection may affect future applications: (1) CIBIL impact - Each loan application creates inquiry, multiple rejections may affect CIBIL, (2) Bank records - Some banks may have internal records of rejections, (3) Application history - Too many rejections in short time may raise concerns. However, if you fix rejection reasons and wait before reapplying, impact is minimal. To minimize impact: (1) Fix rejection reasons before reapplying, (2) Wait 3-6 months between applications, (3) Don't apply to multiple banks simultaneously, (4) Improve your profile before reapplying. Use our calculator to check eligibility before applying to avoid unnecessary rejections.",

      question: "What if I get rejected again?",

        "If you get rejected again: (1) Understand rejection reason - Get detailed rejection letter, understand exactly why loan was rejected, (2) Fix all issues - Address all rejection reasons comprehensively, not just one issue, (3) Wait longer - Wait 6-12 months instead of 3-6 months, (4) Improve significantly - Make significant improvements (CIBIL 750+, add co-applicant, higher income), (5) Try different approach - Consider different loan type, different property, different bank, (6) Get expert help - Work with loan manager to understand and fix all issues. Don't keep reapplying without fixing issues - This may create multiple rejections and affect CIBIL. Use our calculator to check eligibility after comprehensive improvements.",
